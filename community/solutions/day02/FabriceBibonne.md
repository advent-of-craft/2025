# Advent of Craft 2025

## Solution DAY 02

- Contributor Discord Name : fbibonne
- Stack : **Change to Python (PyCharm)** instead of usually java
- Fork : https://github.com/FBibonne/advent-2025/pull/2

## More feedback to share (optional)

- I know very few things in Python language so it was a real challenge for me
- Installation was easy because Python is already installed in my OpenSuse OS and I only had to ask for PyCharm in JetBrains ToolBox which made all the work for me !
- I tried to use IA (Gemini) but it was very slow (bad internet connection maybe ?) and I was faster browsing the answers for my python questions on internet
- The solution of the exercise was quite simple and the fact that most of code was already written was a great help
- Smart autocompletion (complete the full line) of PyCharm (with a local AI agent) was a great help because I was not confident with Python syntax
- I was so happy to write working code that I did not refactor to make it more readable (for example meaningfull names)
